## PolicyPulse – Spot Policy Issues Before They Become Problems

PolicyPulse is your lightweight, no-nonsense tool for scanning text.

It’s like having a super-fast compliance assistant:

It looks for red flags like sensitive terms, suspicious phrases, or personal information.

It uses both straightforward rules (keywords, regex patterns, PII detection) and a tiny machine learning model for trickier cases.

And it shows everything in a clean web dashboard so you can see exactly how many flags are there
